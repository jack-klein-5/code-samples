# code-samples
Hello! My name is Jack Klein, and I'm a professional software developer. This respository's purpose is to have some code samples of things I've done for any prospective employers. Most of them are pretty old, so I added a newer one so you know I've still been working at it. Two are from academic assignments I've had, one from a school game project I worked on over multiple semesters, one is from an old personal project and one from a more recent personal project. I don't have samples from web languages since that work was done professionally and does not belong to me, but I'd love to write new code to showcase my skills if you're interested!

If you'd like to contact me, my email is klein.jack5@gmail.com, and my LinkedIn account url is www.linkedin.com/in/jack-klein5

Thank you for viewing my code samples!
