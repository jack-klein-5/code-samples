# code-samples
Hello! My name is Jack Klein, I'm a senior Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at DigiPen Institute of Technology. This respository's purpose is to have some code samples of things I've done at my time here at DigiPen for any prospective employers. I have four samples here. Two are from assignments I've had, one from a game project I worked on over multiple semesters, and one from my ongoing personal project. 

If you'd like to contact me, my email is klein.jack5@gmail.com, and my LinkedIn account url is www.linkedin.com/in/jack-klein5

Thank you for viewing my code samples!
