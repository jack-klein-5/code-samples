# code-samples
Hello! My name is Jack Klein, I'm a junior Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at DigiPen Institute of Technology. This respository's purpose is to have some code samples of things I've done at my time here at DigiPen for any prospective employers. I have three samples here, two from assignments I've had, and one from a game project I worked on over multiple semesters. 

If you'd like to contact me, my email is jack.klein@digipen.edu, and my LinkedIn account url is www.linkedin.com/in/jack-klein5

Thank you for viewing my code samples!
